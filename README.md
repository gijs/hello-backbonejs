# Hello Backbone - A tutorial

**Hello Backbone** is a simple [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) tutorial comprised of self-explanatory "hello world" examples of increasing complexity. It was designed to provide a smoother transition from zero to the popular [Todos example](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html).

Use:

    docco *.js

in the root directory to compile the docs using [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/).
